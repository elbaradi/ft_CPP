Note: _This was my tenth 42 project, completed November 2021. A series of separate assignments to learn the C++ fundamentals. For every assignment I wrote extensive unit tests. Doing these assignments made me realize how much I've improved in one year of coding, and how much quicker I can now pick up a new language._
